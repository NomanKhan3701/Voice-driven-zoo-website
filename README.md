# Voice-driven-zoo-website
We all know we dont like to type sometimes /use our mouse or read out something. We like someone to do it for us so that we can get comfortable and let our assistant to the work for us ( Inspired from Jarvis in Iron Man ). This site provides you with this eye catching features. Also when we plan to visit the zoo, most of the time we are not able to watch all the animals we planned to watch because of shortage of time. This problem is solved by adding a path finding algorithm so that the user can get the most out of his visit. The user will select the animals he wants to visit from a given list, than the path finding algorithm will give him/her the chronological order in which he should visit all of them to save time.
